//That's the data structure for storing a single search node.
//Although one might realize A* pathfinder relying only on g-value,
//it's a good idea to store f- and h-values explicitly for the sake of simplicity
//(and either h- or f-value is definetely needed for realizing different tie-breaking strategies).
//Backpointer is obligatory for any-angle algorithms, e.g. Theta*, and it makes sense to utilize it
//in A*-like algorithms as well for reconstructing path (after the main search phase is finished).

//So, in the end of the day, we have a sort of "universal" search-node structure
//compatable with various types of grid pathfinders (Dijkstra, A*, Jump Point Search, Theta* etc.)
//which means - that's all you need for that project.
